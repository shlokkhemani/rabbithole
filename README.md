# Rabbithole

**An infinite canvas for learning.** Open a document, select any text, ask a
question — and the answer opens as a fully-rendered child document. Recurse as
deep as you like. Every hole is saved and revisitable.

Rabbithole is an MCP server. Your terminal agent (Claude Code, Codex, or any
MCP client) does the answering; Rabbithole gives it a canvas in your browser.
Everything runs locally — no account, no API keys, nothing leaves your machine.

## Quick start

Requires Node 18+ and a browser. Pick your agent:

**Claude Code**

```bash
claude mcp add rabbithole -- npx -y github:shlokkhemani/rabbithole
```

**Codex**

```bash
codex mcp add rabbithole -- npx -y github:shlokkhemani/rabbithole
```

**Any other MCP client** — add this to its MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rabbithole": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:shlokkhemani/rabbithole"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then start a new agent session and say:

> open this document in rabbithole

A browser tab opens. Select any text on the page, ask a question (or tap a
lens — Explain · ELI5 · Example · Go Deeper), and the answer streams in as a
new document. Keep going.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shlokkhemani/rabbithole.git
cd rabbithole && npm install
claude mcp add rabbithole -- node "$(pwd)/bin/mcp-server.js"
```

## 🤖 If you are an AI agent setting this up

Follow these steps exactly:

1. **Check Node**: `node --version` must be ≥ 18.
2. **Register the server** with the one-liner above that matches the agent
   you are running inside (`claude mcp add …` for Claude Code, `codex mcp add …`
   for Codex, or write the JSON block into the client's MCP config file).
   The `npx -y github:shlokkhemani/rabbithole` form needs no clone and no
   install step — npx fetches this repo and runs `bin/mcp-server.js` over stdio.
3. **Verify**: after the client reconnects, three tools should be available —
   `open_rabbithole`, `answer_branch`, `list_rabbitholes`. (In Claude Code,
   `claude mcp list` should show `rabbithole` as connected. The server itself
   also responds to a standard MCP `initialize` with server name `rabbithole`.)
4. **Tell your human what to do next**: they should start a session and say
   *"open &lt;some document&gt; in rabbithole"* — you then call `open_rabbithole`
   with `{ title, content }` (or `{ title, file_path }`; add `base_url` when
   markdown contains relative links/images), which blocks until they select text
   and ask. Answer with `answer_branch` (stream chunks with
   `partial: true`, finish with a titled final call) and keep looping until
   `status='session_closed'`.

Notes for you: the tool call blocks by design (long-poll) — that is normal, not
a hang. First `npx` run takes ~15–30s while it fetches the repo; later runs are
cached. If the browser must not auto-open (headless), set
`RABBITHOLE_NO_BROWSER=1` in the server's env.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `open_rabbithole` | Open a doc (`{ title, content }` / `{ title, file_path }`, optional `base_url` for relative Markdown links/images) or resume one (`{ hole_id }`). Opens the canvas in the browser and blocks until the human asks something. |
| `answer_branch` | Answer a pending branch request → a child document. Stream with `partial: true` chunks, then finish with a normal call carrying the node title. |
| `list_rabbitholes` | List saved holes to resume by id. |

The loop: `open_rabbithole` → `branch_request` → `answer_branch` → `branch_request` → … → `session_closed`.

## What's inside

- **Reader mode (default):** fullscreen reading, branches sidebar, breadcrumbs;
  selections become inline marks (pending → ready); hover a ready mark for a
  peek preview; child docs carry a FROM strip that jumps back to the exact origin.
- **Streamed answers:** words appear live with a breathing caret — in the
  reader, the thread, and the canvas card.
- **Lenses:** one-tap presets on the ask popup — Explain · ELI5 · Example ·
  Go Deeper (keys 1–4).
- **Follow-up chat:** a composer under each document asks about the doc as a
  whole; answers render inline and are branchable like any other text.
- **Canvas mode:** infinite pan/zoom, draggable/resizable cards, edges that
  attach to the exact selected text in the parent, collapse, auto-layout.
- **Navigation:** `j`/`k` walk marks, `↵` opens, `⌫` jumps back up, `⌘K` searches
  the whole hole.
- **Share/export:** copy any trail or document as Markdown, download a frozen
  single-file snapshot, or ask the agent for a synthesis of the whole journey.
- **Durable asks:** questions asked while the agent is away are saved and
  re-queued on resume — the agent answers them first thing.
- **Persistence:** holes auto-save as JSON under `~/.rabbithole/`; resuming
  restores the doc, scroll position, mode, and canvas framing.

## Configuration

| Env var | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `RABBITHOLE_DIR` | Override the storage directory (default `~/.rabbithole/`). |
| `RABBITHOLE_NO_BROWSER=1` | Don't auto-open the browser (headless/testing). |

## Repo layout

- `bin/mcp-server.js` — entry point (stdio MCP server)
- `src/` — server, canvas UI (self-contained HTML), storage
- `website/` — [rabbithole.ing](https://rabbithole.ing), a Next.js single-page site
